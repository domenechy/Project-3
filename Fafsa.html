                The first step in receiving any type of federal financial aid is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
                Federal student aid includes grants, work-study opportunities and student loans.
                The FAFSA is also required for some scholarships. 
                If youâ€™re not a senior in high school yet, you have some time before you'll need to complete the form.
                If you are a high school senior, you'll need to submit the form this year to find out what federal and state financial aid options are available to you.
            </td>
        
            <td>
                1- Complete the FAFSA after October 1st each year, beginning with your senior year of high school.
                Remember, you'll need to submit the FAFSA each year of college in order to stay eligible for federal financial aid.
                <br>
                2- The first letter in FAFSA stands for <b>FREE.</b> Never pay to complete the application.
                <br>
                3-Even if you don't think you'll qualify for financial aid, submit the FAFSA anyway.
                Most students qualify for some type of financial assistance for college.

            <td>
                The current deadline to apply to Fafsa in New Jersey is April 15th of each year by midnight.<br>
                However, deadlines might change, it's always best to contact your financial aid administrator<br>
                or state agency just to make sure.
